# PIZZA
## INGREDIENTS:

*Dough*
- 800g 00-Tipo flour
- 512g water (64% hydration)
- 3-4g active dry yeast
- 16g fine sea salt

*Toppings and Sauce*
- 28oz can peeled whole San Marzano tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2.5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- salt to taste
- 3 balls of mozzarella di bufala campana
- fresh basil
- additional extra virgin olive oil for topping

## HOW TO PREPARE:

*Dough*
1. Heat water to 95F. 
2. Add instant yeast, stirring together, and let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. 
3. In a large bowl, mix together 00-Tipo flour and fine sea salt. 
4. Add all the water to the flour and mix by hand until a shaggy dough forms. 
5. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature. 
6. Remove dough onto a work surface and knead using the slap and fold method for 1-2 minutes or until the dough starts to turn smooth. 
7. Transfer the dough back to the bowl, cover, and let rest for 15 more minutes. 
8. Slap and fold again for 1-2 minutes, roll into a taut bowl, and place back into a bowl coated in extra virgin olive oil. Completely cover with plastic wrap and fridge for 14-18 hours. 
9. Punch all the air out of the dough. Divide dough into 5 even pieces (250 g each). Push out all the air and fold all the sides in before rolling into a taut ball seam side down. 
10. Add to a proofing box (or rimmed baking sheet dusted with flour), cover, and let proof at room temperature for 3-4 hours. 

*Sauce*
1. Add tomatoes to a large bowl using a strainer, squeezing out the excess water. Add all the tomato flesh to a food processor along with garlic cloves, and extra virgin olive. 
2. Process until extremely smooth and season to taste with salt and a pinch of sugar. 
3. Blend together and pass through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing out as much pulp as possible into a container.
