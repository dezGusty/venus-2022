# History

Our restaurant was founded in 2022, in order to fulfill the requests of the customers in one of the most popular Black Sea locations in Romania: Venus.

We try our best to always bring fresh food and we are also open about the methods that we use for cooking. For that matter, we have also added to our menu the recipes for 
all our products. 

We also invite people to our kitchen if they want to see their food being prepared or even get themselves involved in the process, being one of the first restaurants in 
Romania to do bring this kind of transparency to the customers.
